### More Technically

#### 1. Simple Mode

![Screencast](./docs/arch-simple.png)

1. Telegram invokes serverless function on every update.
1. Function collects all information needed, reposts them to slides channel **and uploads slides to the Drive.**
1. Installed Google Drive desktop app automatically synchronizes cloud and local folders and files appears on the computer.

Limitations: according to the current [Telegram Bot API limitations](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile) bots  can't download files larger 20mb. To avoid this, use advanced mode.

#### 2. Advanced Mode
